# Session 2
August 8th, 2024

## DM Session Review:

---

Group N(octurnal) completed Session Two on 08 Aug.<br>
The group gathered again the next night at the universities bat Aviary to meet with Senectus, but instead found the front door demolished and the signs of an extensive fight on the grounds.  Shortly after they heard retorts of spells going off on the other side of the boundary walls.  There they found a fettered (warforged) named Marcelo being harried by a gang of thugs.<br>
A quick offer of 500gp for help capturing the fettered ensured that the group would instead assist the Marcelo fight off his attackers.  A quick skirmish quickly delt with the street thugs but their employer had arrived, and his bodyguards had been making ominous noises around the bodies of the fallen thugs.  A quick order set the bodyguards to abandon consuming the fallen thugs and charge the party.  Where their heads had been a mass of centipedes had erupted and they charged the party.<br>
How will they deal with this corrupt display and what magics does this man employ to command such horrors?  Why are they after Marcelo and were they the party that abducted Senectus?
