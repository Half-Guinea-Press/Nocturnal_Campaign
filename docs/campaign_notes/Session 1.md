# Session 1
August 1st, 2024

## DM Session Review:

Group N(octurnal) completed Session One on 01 Aug.  The leader of the party, Senectus,  is researching Vampirism and heard rumors of a half-vampire in the market.  While he traveled there he encountered a strange man, Janus, attempting to campaign to be elected as governor of the city, which is ran by a council of judges and has no governor.  They soon encountered a steelie eyed individual, Valrdis,  and their partner a gargoyle, Monic, in the process of repo'g some merchandise for a client.  Valrdis agreed to speak with Senectus and assist him with locating, Esmerelda, a vampire supposedly in the local area. 
While discussing the job they were interrupted by another scholar at the college, Ten Dead Seas whom asked Valrdis if they could accept an immediate case of some stolen materials from his lab by a suspected student.  After agreeing and discussing payment Ten Dead Seas quietly asked why Senectus had one of the ruling judiciary, nodding at Janus before leaving.
