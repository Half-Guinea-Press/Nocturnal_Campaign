<h1 id="equipment">Equipment<a class="headerlink" href="#equipment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>A ppearing within this chapter are new items you can find during your adventures, as well as revised mechanics for certain alchemical items that previously appeared in the Player’s Handbook. The chapter begins with a section on new and reprinted Adventuring Gear, with Alchemical Items appearing afterwords.</p>
<p>When you choose the formulae for alchemical items you know as an Alchemist, the applicable items appear in the Adventuring Gear (Alchemical Items) table.</p>
<p>Revised Items</p>
<p>The design process of this class exposed a few hiccups with the original alchemical items in the Player’s Handbook, which could cause some confusion and potential unintended interactions. In short, these are quality of life mechanical changes to help clarify the use of these items with no change made to damage. A full breakdown of the reasons for these revisions is detailed in Appendix C.</p>
<p>Adventuring Gear</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated in its description, if an item calls for an action, it is used with the Use an Object action.</p>
<p>Alembic. An airtight, glass distillation device.</p>
<p>Astrolabe. An astrolabe can be used as a part of making an ability check to navigate at night while stars or other planetary bodies are visible. If you do, the check is made with advantage.</p>
<p>Bellows. A device used to furnish a strong, short blast of air through a nozzle.</p>
<p>Brazier. A portable container used to burn charcoal or fuel.</p>
<p>Candle Mold. A mold is required, in addition to any wax, to make any candle with a weight of 1 pound or less.</p>
<p>Coffee Grounds. Boiling water can be poured through coffee grounds and filtered to make a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Crucible. A small ceramic or metal container that can hold molten substances without breaking.</p>
<p>Earplugs. Made from solid sponge or cork, a creature wearing these earplugs is effectively deafened.</p>
<p>Glass Cutter. This special device allows you to cut through glass as thick as a half-inch, creating a circular hole between 3 to 16 inches wide (your choice).</p>
<p>Hammock. A portable sling bed made of interwoven rope or other textiles. It can be hung between two posts or trees to create a comfortable, elevated sleeping area.</p>
<p>Adventuring Gear</p>
<p>Item Cost Weight</p>
<p>Alembic 12 gp 1 lb.</p>
<p>Astrolabe 2 gp 1 lb.</p>

<p>Heat Mat. A 1 square foot mat made of heat-absorbing materials. The mat can withstand temperatures of up to 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit without catching fire. It can be used to handle flaming hot objects for short periods of time without burning the creature carrying it.</p>
<p>Heatsuit Outfit. Clothing designed to protect the wearer against the effects of extreme heat, such as temperatures found around forges and volcanoes. It consists of heavy pants and coat, a specially treated leather apron, very thick mittens, a thick hood, and goggles.</p>
<p>Magnet, Small. This small magnet can be used to attract loose metal items or stick to ferrous objects. It is only power- ful enough to attract metal that weighs 3 ounces or less.</p>
<p>Mortar and Pestle. A bowl and crusher used to grind material down to powder.</p>
<p>Periscope. A small, handheld periscope roughly 1 foot long. If you use a periscope while behind cover, you can look over obstacles and around corners without exposing yourself to danger.</p>
<p>Shriek Rock. These flat stones have carefully drilled holes that cause a loud, high-pitched “shriek” when thrown hard. This sound is as loud as a human screaming in a shrill voice.</p>
<p>Telescope. An instrument used to view planetary bodies.</p>
<p>Test Kit. This kit contains various materials for the testing of unknown magical and mundane fluids. A single kit typically contains leather gloves, clippers, five glass vials, strips of alchemical testing paper, a flask of alcohol. The kit has ten uses, one of which you can spend to gain advantage on an applicable Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>
<p>Tongs. These are 1-foot-long metal tongs used to pick up objects that weigh as much as 1 pound without touching them directly.</p>
<p>New Equipment Packs</p>
<p>New packs are available to choose from when you choose your starting equipment. The contents of these packs are listed here. If you are buying your starting equipment, you can purchase a pack for the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.</p>
<p>Astronomer’s Pack (40 gp). Includes a backpack, an astrolabe, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, a telescope, a scroll case full of diagrams on celestial bodies, and 10 sheets of parchment.</p>
<p>Demolitionist’s Pack (35 gp). Includes a backpack, bedroll, 3 flasks, 4 clay pots, earplugs, a hooded lantern, and a vial of gunpowder. The pack also has 30 feet of fuse packed within the chest.</p>
<p>Detective’s Pack (15 gp). Includes a backpack, a magnifying glass, a mask, a set of tongs, and a test kit.</p>
<p>Mediciner’s Pack (22 gp). Includes a backpack, a hammock, 3 flasks, 5 glass bottles, 10 days of rations, a waterskin, a healer’s kit, and an herbalism kit.</p>
<p>Tools</p>
<p>The following tools have been reproduced and reorganized here with their relevant information for ease of play with this class.</p>
<p>Artisan’s Tools</p>
<p>Player’s Handbook p. 154</p>
<p>These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade. Proficiency with a set of artisan’s tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools in your craft.</p>
<p>Alchemist’s Supplies</p>
<p>Alchemist’s supplies include two glass beakers, a metal frame to hold a beaker in place over an open flame, a glass stirring rod, a small mortar and pestle, and a pouch of common alchemical ingredients, including salt, powdered iron, and purified water.</p>
<p>Crafting. You can use this tool proficiency to create alchemical items. A character can spend money to collect raw materials, which weigh 1 pound for every 50 gp spent. The DM can allow a character to make a check using the indicated skill with advantage. As part of a long rest, you can use alchemist’s supplies to make one alchemical item with a value as high as 50 gp. Subtract half the value of the created item from the total gp worth of raw materials you are carrying.</p>
<p>Herbalism Kit</p>
<p>Proficiency with an herbalism kit allows you to identify plants and safely collect their useful elements. An herbalism kit includes pouches to store herbs, clippers and leather gloves for collecting plants, a mortar and pestle, and several glass jars.</p>
<p>Containers</p>
<p>Liquids must be used in specific volumes for their effects to occur. The container listed in the item and indicated in this column indicates the minimum amount of the substance required for its full effects to occur.</p>
<p>Container Capacity</p>

<p>These items can be purchased with your starting equipment and crafted with alchemist’s supplies. They are shown in the Adventuring Gear (Alchemical Items) table with a Container, Cost, and Weight (Wt.), and described in the Alchemical Items section in this chapter.</p>
<p>Some alchemical items have a secondary classification, shown in italics. This is meant for ease of reference, but certain classifications obey certain rules:</p>
<p>Acid. Acids are naturally occurring or originate from a certain creature (such as a black dragon). However, some acids are mundane chemical mixtures that may be created in a laboratory with alchemist’s supplies and are listed here.</p>
<p>Oils. Oils are nearly always a substance that must be coated onto a creature or object. The action required to do so is listed in its description.</p>

<p>Potions of Healing. The container, cost, and weight for potions of healing have been reproduced here for reference.</p>
<p>Item Type: Alchemical Item</p>
<p>This supplement aims to solidify a term that has mostly been used in abstraction; “alchemical items.” This is not a blanket term to refer to “any item an alchemist can make,” but rather a classification of “nonmagical items created through a process of chemical reactions.” For example, the alchemist’s fire is considered to be a chemical substance that ignites when exposed to the air through natural reactions, but a potion of healing is a liquid that magically mends wounds by consuming it.</p>
<p>When playing this class, it should be understood that if a feature refers to an alchemical item, it is not being used to encompass poisons or potions unless specifically stated. Features like Alchemy and Lightning in a Bottle are designed and balanced around this assumption. This class allows you to create alchemical items in the middle of combat, while still providing you with the features to create permanent potions more easily within the official rules provided for downtime crafting.</p>
<p>Alchemical Item Descriptions</p>
<p>The alchemical items are listed in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>Acid, Oxidizing Agent</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p>
<p>You can splash the contents of the vial or throw it, shattering the vial, up to 20 feet as a ranged simple weapon attack with either the Attack or Use an Object action. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the acid corrodes nonmagical ferrous metal, dealing 2d10 acid damage if the target is a construct made of metal. If the target is an object that isn’t being worn or carried, the acid destroys a 1-footradius circle that is 1-inch deep. If the target is a creature wearing or carrying the object, choose one of the objects to target from either its armor, shield, or weapon:</p>
<p>• The armor or shield takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed.</p>

<p>• Candle, Insectbane</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. This heavily scented candle smells pleasant to humanoids, but is especially potent in repelling insects, which are frightened while within 20 feet of a burning insectbane candle.</p>

<p>• Clearbreath</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p>
<p>Gray, smokey vapors that temporarily dull one’s sense of smell when inhaled. You can use the vial to inhale the clearbreath within to gain a bonus to Constitution saving throws made against foul smells (such as a catoblepas’ stench) for 1 hour.

<p>• Darkvision Powder</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p>
<p>This plain gray powder can’t be seen with normal vision from more than 10 feet away, and is often used by creatures with darkvision to write messages hidden in plain sight.

<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p>
<p>This vile liquid has a muddy brown hue and smells of rotten plant life. You can throw a flask of defoliator at a target within 20 feet with either the Attack or Use Object action, shattering the flask on impact. All plant creatures within 10 feet of the point must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 poison damage. Medium or smaller naturally growing plants in the area immediately wither and die. The damage is not limited to living plants: wooden objects and structures take double damage from a defoliator.</p>
<p>• Dwarfblind Stone</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Small stones treated with alchemical substances, giving them a faint purple sheen. As an action, you can throw a dwarfblind stone at a point up to 60 feet away. Once the stone strikes a hard surface, it releases a burst of violet light that illuminates a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the point that vanishes in an instant and temporarily interferes with the darkvision. Creatures with darkvision within the area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or lose their darkvision for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>• Fleetfoot</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p>

<p>• Gravebane</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p>
<p>This thick white liquid evaporates almost instantly upon contact with air, creating a thin, nearly invisible smoke. The smoke is nearly odorless and has no effect on most creatures. Undead, however, are repulsed by the smoke and can only pass through it with an effort of will. As an action, you open or throw the flask to a point up to 20 feet away, shattering the flask. In either case, the area in a 10-foot radius becomes filled with gravebane. Gravebane ordinarily lasts for 1 minute, although strong winds may decrease this duration. Undead that try to enter the area must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from the area of smoke as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of the smoke. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action to try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
<p>• Green Slime</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Pot (1 gallon)</p>
<p>You can throw this pot of green slime at a target within 20 feet with either the Attack or Use Object action, breaking it open on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against the creature or object, treating the green slime as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 acid damage and is covered in slime until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the slime off. A target covered in the slime takes 1d10 acid damage at the start of each of its turns.</p>
<p>• Healing Draught</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical Item)</p>
<p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p>

<p>• Holy Water</p>
<p>Adventuring Gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p>
<p>As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the holy water as a ranged simple weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.</p>
<p>A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1<sup>st</sup>-level spell slot.</p>
<p>• Insect Repellent-Salve</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p>
<p>A vial of this waterproof salve contains 20 applications of odorless grease. Applying the salve takes 1 minute, and one application protects its wearer against normal insects for 24 hours.</p>
<p>• Instant Rope</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p>
<p>As an action, you can pour the viscous gray liquid from this flask. When poured, the liquid forms into a long cord usable as a temporary rope. Upon being exposed to air, the liquid rapidly increases in both volume and viscosity, swelling to the diameter of a typical hemp rope, then quickly drying.</p>
<p>A flask of instant rope forms a 50-foot-long cord and solidifies at the end of your next turn. The rope can be moved during this period without damaging it, but it cannot support more than 10 pounds of weight without breaking. Once completely dry, instant rope can support as much weight as normal hemp rope. After an hour, instant rope becomes too brittle to support any weight and quickly crumbles into dust.</p>
<p>• Instant Wall</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p>
<p>A foamy compound that quickly expands and hardens when exposed to air. You can throw this flask at a point within 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, the contents of the vial expand to a 10-foot-square panel of tough stone-like matter that is 1 foot thick, with the face of the wall facing you. The wall lasts until the end of your next turn, then it crumbles to dust.</p>
<p>If the block cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to the opposite side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save. The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 10 hit points, and is vulnerable to bludgeoning and thunder damage.</p>
<p>• Levin Shell</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p>
<p>An unstable mass of electric energy that sparks when exposed to air. You can throw this flask up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the levin shell as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the target and any creatures within 5 feet of the target take 1d6 lightning damage. Any creature that takes this damage suffers a 1d4 penalty to Dexterity saving throws until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p>• Longbreath</p>
<p>Adventuring Gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p>
<p>This thick, brown-tinted smoke is a great boon to anyone who needs to go without air for more than a few rounds. For 1 hour after inhaling the contents of the vial, the creature can hold its breath indefinitely while it’s not incapacitated.</p>
<p>•Motelight</p>
<p>Adventuring Gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p>
<p>This flask contains a clear liquid filled with faintly glowing sparks of light. You can throw this flask at a point up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When it shatters, any creatures within 5 feet of the point become surrounded by rapidly moving, harmless sparks that follow the creature until the start of your next turn. These sparks carry wild energy that disrupts magic, and if the creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a concentration check or the spell fails and the spell slot is expended.</p>
<p>• Oil, Basic</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p>
<p>As an action, you can splash the oil onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the oil as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil, which is burned away. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p>
<p>• Oil, Anointing</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p>
<p>Anointing oil is used in religious ceremonies, often as a mix of oil and holy water. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action, coating the item for 1 hour. When you hit a fiend or undead with the coated item, the attack deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.</p>
<p>• Oil, Bladefire</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p>
<p>Bladefire is typically poured along the length of a bladed metal weapon. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action. For 1 hour, the coated item sheds light as if it were a torch and deals an extra 1d4 fire damage on a hit. While coated, the item can ignite a flammable object it touches as an action. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.</p>
<p>• Oil, Crone’s Ire</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>A sickly emerald oil that shrieks when lit. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action. For 1 hour, the coated item sheds dim light out to 5 feet and deals an extra 1d4 necrotic damage on a hit. If this damage forces a creature to make a concentration check, the necrotic damage dealt is subtracted from its roll. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.</p>
<p>• Oil, Dragonwound</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p>
<p>Dragonwound oil is typically poured along the length of a bladed metal weapon. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action, coating the item for 1 hour. When you hit a dragon with the coated item, the dragon takes an extra 1d6 force damage and its fly speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.</p>
<p>• Oil, Farflame</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p>
<p>This thin, light blue oil burns with a blue flame and illuminates a wide area. When used in a lantern, farflame oil sheds bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. In a bullseye lantern, it illuminates a cone 80 feet long and 25 feet wide. A pint of farflame oil fuels a lantern for 3 hours and can cover a 5-foot square area if poured on the ground. If lit, farflame oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d4 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area.</p>
<p>• Oil, Ghostflame</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>This clear oil has a slight tint of gray, and strange, wispy forms seem to swirl through it. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action. For 1 hour, attacks made with the weapon count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.</p>
<p>• Oil, Vicious Bleeder</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>A thick blue oil that acts as a powerful anticoagulant. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action, coating the item for 1 hour. When you make an attack against a creature that is not a construct, elemental, ooze, or undead with the coated item, the attack deals an additional 1d6 damage and the creature bleeds heavily from the wound for 1 hour, granting advantage on any ability check made to track it. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.</p>
<p>• Perfume (vial)</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>A fragrant commodity typically used by the wealthy.</p>
<p>• Polar Skin</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p>
<p>This dull white cream provides limited protection against the cold when applied to a creature. A vial of this dull-white cream contains 20 applications. Applying the cream takes 1 minute, and one application protects its wearer against the effects of extreme cold for 24 hours.</p>
<p>• Shriek Paste</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p>
<p>The shrieker, a common fungus found in the bowels of the Underdark, is sometimes cultivated by drow societies, creating a first line of defense against intrusion around their cities. In addition, drow alchemists harvest and render the fungus down to a base substance capable of reproducing the shrieker’s howl.</p>
<p>Shriek paste is an oily, smelly substance with a slightly purplish color that is typically stored in opaque containers to prevent illuminating the paste. When smeared on a surface, it retains its same consistency almost indefinitely. When bright light is within 30 feet of the paste, the paste rapidly crystallizes. During this process, the paste emits a shriek audible within 300 feet of it for 1 minute. If the light moves out of range, the shriek ends after 1d4 rounds. Afterward, the paste dries up and is rendered inert.</p>
<p>• Spark of Creation</p>
<p>Wondrous item (alchemical item), very rare</p>
<p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p>
<p>A terrifying substance said to be incomprehensibly volatile and massless, though theorized to have been an essence that triggered the beginning of everything. You can throw this flask up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object. On a hit, eight 5-foot diameter crystaline spires burst forth at points of your choice within 30 feet of the shattered flask. Each spire has a height of up to 30 feet, with AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a spire crumbles to rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 5-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.</p>
<p>If the spire is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the spire. A creature can choose to fail this save.</p>
<p>If a spire is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the spire takes 6d6 piercing damage and is restrained, pinned between the spire and the obstacle. The restained creature can use an action to make a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity check (the creature’s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restained and must either move off the pillar or fall off of it.</p>
<p>• Splash Catalyst</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p>
<p>When combined with an alchemical item or potion, the catalyst increases the item’s volatility. If the item only targets a single creature, you can instead target a point within the same range. All creatures within 5 feet of the point must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw (which they can choose to fail) or be subjected to the item’s effects as if they had been hit by an attack made using the item.</p>
<p>• Soap</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>A commodity used for bathing.</p>
<p>• Sparkstone</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>These alchemical devices actually resemble fist-sized lumps of hard, gray clay. You can throw a sparkstone up to 20 feet at a target as a ranged simple weapon attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 lightning damage and can’t take reactions until the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>• Smelling Salts</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p>
<p>As an action, this vial of pungent fluid can be administered by wafting the contents under a creature’s nose. If the creature is unconscious by an effect that put it to sleep, it immediately wakes up.</p>
<p>• Smokestick</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>As an action, you can ignite this alchemically treated wooden stick to instantly produce a thick plume of opaque smoke that blocks vision, including darkvision. You can hold onto the stick or throw it to a point up to 30 feet away as a part of the action used to ignite it. The area in a 10-foot radius around the stick is filled with thick smoke. The stick and smoke persist for 1 minute and then disappear.</p>
<p>• Sunrod</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck. You can strike the sunrod as an action, causing it to provide bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.</p>
<p>• Tanglefoot Bag</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Sack</p>
<p>This bag is filled with writhing, sticky black tar. As an action, you can burst the bag on a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, which causes the goo in the bag to burst out. In either case, make a ranged attack against the target, treating the bag as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the target becomes grappled by the goo (escape DC 10) that starts to harden when exposed to the air. A tanglefoot bag has no effect underwater. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.</p>
<p>The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 1 hour, freeing any creatures restrained by it.</p>
<p>• Thunderstone</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>You can throw this stone at a point within 20 feet with either the Attack or Use Object action. When it strikes a hard surface, it creates a deafening bang, forcing each creature within 10 feet of the point to make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn. A creature deafened in this way also has disadvantage on initiative checks.</p>
<p>• Torch, Beast-Repellent</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20- foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage. A beast-repellent torch burns with an unnatural dark flame that unsettles beasts. A beast within 30 feet of a burning beast-repellent torch that can see it must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the torch until it is attacked or takes damage. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature cannot be frightened by beast-repellent torches for 24 hours.</p>
<p>• Torch, Frigidflame</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright white light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch of frigidflame and hit, it deals 1 cold damage.</p>
<p>• Torch, Sentry</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright all-revealing light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage. Invisible creatures and objects within the bright light provided by the sentry torch become visible.</p>
<p>• Torch, Tindertwig</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. You can ignite it as an action by hitting a solid surface. The flame does not damage the tindertwig and can ignite a flammable object it touches. You can snuff out the flame as an action.</p>
<p>• Verminbane</p>
<p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p>
<p>Container: Flash (1 pint)</p>
<p>This tightly sealed flask contains a pale green smoke. When released into the air, the smoke fills a 5-foot-square area. Most creatures are unaffected by the smoke, although humanoids generally find the smell unpleasant. Rats and other rodents, however, find the smoke almost intolerable. As an action, you open or throw the flask to a point up to 20 feet away, shattering the flask. In either case, the area in a 10-foot radius becomes heavily obscured with verminbane smoke. Verminbane ordinarily lasts for 1 minute, although strong winds may decrease this duration.</p>
<p>Rodent-like creatures (DMs discretion) that attempt to enter the area must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is frightened of the smoke and must spend its turns trying to move as far away from the area of smoke as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of the smoke. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action to try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
<p>Poisons</p>
<p>Poisons come in the following four types. The Craftable Poisons table listed below details the poisons that do not require harvesting from a certain creature to make that are listed in the official books.</p>
<p>Contact. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.</p>
<p>Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.</p>
<p>Inhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p>
<p>Injury. Can be applied to one slashing or piercing weapon, up to three pieces of ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent for 1 minute. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.</p>
