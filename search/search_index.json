Through a combination of fast-talking, determination, and official-looking documentation, you can gain access to a place or an individual related to a crime you're investigating.

Ever since, other spectral clients have sought you out to help them find rest. 4   You revealed that the monsters terrorizing your home were illusions created by a cruel mage. The magic-user escaped, but you've continued to uncover magical hoaxes. 5   You were wrongfully accused and convicted of a crime. You managed to escape and seek to help others avoid the experience you suffered, even while still being pursued by the law. 6   You survived the destructive use of a magic device that wiped out your home.

You now work with them, tracking down dangerous supernatural phenomena and preventing them from doing harm. 7   You found evidence of a conspiracy underpinning society. You tried to expose this mysterious cabal, but no one believed you. You're still trying to prove what you know is true. 8   You got a job with an agency that investigates crimes that local law enforcement can't solve. You often wonder which you value more, the truth or your pay. Horror Characteristics Characters in a horror-focused campaign might have distinct motivations and characteristics.

There\u2019s been a debate online about how these items are intended to be used, without clear ruling having been given by Wizards of the Coast.</p> <p>Use an Object</p> <p>You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.</p> <p>For those unfamiliar with the problem; Acid, Alchemist\u2019s Fire, and Holy Water were all written essentially as follows:</p> <p>Alchemical Item. As an action, you can splash the contents of this container onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the item as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is subjected to the item\u2019s effects.</p> <p>This wording can be a bit unclear or potentially bring up issues for a few reasons. This isn\u2019t to say these are intended for the mechanic, just the logic that leads to misinterpretations:</p> <p>\u2022 The addition of \u201cmake a ranged attack\u201d in the item\u2019s description could be interpreted to mean your Dexterity modifier is added to, at the very least, the first damage roll of the item. Despite him saying not to take his Tweets at face value, Jeremy Crawford has stated this was how the item is intended to work, although it\u2019s worth mentioning here that I disagree with the Dexterity modifier adding to the subsequent rolls of alchemist\u2019s fire.</p> <p>\u2022 The mechanics for Improvised Weapons imply that an improvised weapon attack can be made with any object using the Attack action. The addition of \u201cimprovised weapon\u201d in the item\u2019s description and the fact that an alchemical item within a vial doesn\u2019t shatter by, effectively, performing the same actions in the narrative is counter-intuitive and seems to only be put in place to prevent martialists from using more than one of these items at a time.</p> <p>\u2022 The item itself does not specifically state if the use includes the damage of an improvised weapon. That\u2019s before even talking about the \u201cNet Problem\u201d, wherein an item or weapon that calls for a ranged attack against a creature within 5 feet of you is always made with disadvantage.</p> <p>Improvised Weapons</p> <p>Player\u2019s Handbook pp. 147-148</p> <p>Sometimes characters don\u2019t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM\u2019s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.</p> <p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals ld4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals ld4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p> <p>Attack for Alchemical Item</p> <p>This interaction would cause the item to deal 1d4 + Dexterity modifier damage when used as a ranged improvised weapon, but the judgment on whether or not this specific interaction would cause the item to work would point towards \u201cno\u201d, which is just bad narrative conveyance. Use Object for Alchemical Item</p> <p>This appears to be the intended action to use for alchemical items, with the interaction itself simply lifting the clause for improvised weapons. The murkiness happens when you look at the text for improvised weapons, which states that in doing so it deals 1d4 damage of a type appropriate for the item, with nothing in either the item or Improvised Weapon wording clarifying whether or not this additional damage applies to the damage dealt in the item\u2019s description.</p> <p>The Fix</p> <p>Moving alchemical items away from the Use an Object action and over towards the Attack action actually updates the Player\u2019s Handbook to be consistent with the mechanics for alchemical items in later books. Remove Improvised from Alchemical Items. This \u201ccoding\u201d for the items only exists in the Player\u2019s Handbook. Attack or Use an Object.

This is a thing you could already do within the offi - cial rules. The alchemist can just do it more efficiently through their Experimentalist Adept feature.</p> <p>Question: What do the crafting rules mean by gold required if crafting requires materials to craft the item?</p> <p>Answer: The Cost indicated in the Player\u2019s Handbook and simi - lar materials list the \u201cmarket value\u201d of the item. This has been used in the Player\u2019s Handbook, Dungeon Masters Guide, and a few other official books. When you craft an item, the term \u201craw materials\u201d is used to refer to essentially \u201canything re - quired to make the item (DM\u2019s discretion)\u201d. This supplement adopts this and is designed to embrace it rather than override the base crafting system.</p> <p>Question: So I don\u2019t have to spend gold to craft?</p> <p>Answer: No. The gold called for is the market value of the item. In the case of single-use items (such as most alchemical items and consumable potions), you divide the market value in half to get you the cost of raw materials required to create the item. You may have to spend gold to gather raw materials, but this supple - ment provides a variant rule for gathering them whole foraging.</p> <p>Question: Does the new wording for Alchemical Items cause them to interact with Archery &amp; Sharpshooter?</p> <p>Answer: Here\u2019s the thing; they already did. It seems to me that there\u2019s a belief that they shouldn\u2019t, so if you\u2019re not comfortable with this interaction, I would suggest a rule that those features only work with bows and crossbows.</p> <p>Question: Why can\u2019t we make this character in the base game?</p> <p>Answer: I feel that the Artificer Alchemist isn\u2019t a great repre - sentation of the traditional archetype of an alchemist. The tie-in with the Artificer seems to inject a certain flavor on the character option that had turned me away from it.</p> <p>\u2022 Underserved/Restrictive Crafting Rules: The rules for craft - ing in 5e essentially gate martial crafters out of reasonable combat effectiveness.</p> <p>\u2022 Object Permanence: When you create a potion, you would like for it to remain permanently until used. However, this causes issues with what I call \u201cBatman Prep.\u201d Batman prep means that, if allowed the time and resources, a character can do something that makes them effectively unstoppable in any situation. Potions of healing last indefinitely, which means that\u2019s a narrative expectation we should be aiming to design for.</p> <p>\u2022 Ignorance of Encumbrance: The most common houserule out of any houserule is that players are likely allowed to ignore what\u2019s in their pack (within reason). We cannot bal - ance around encumbrance in 5e because items like the bag of holding exist and are basically expected for a party to have before 5<sup>th</sup> level.</p> <p>\u2022 Value over Interaction: The general rules for collecting materials that would be used in creating potions is mostly limited in description to \u201cgp value\u201d rather than a hard-set material narrative.</p> <p>Creature Statistics</p> <p>The following statblocks can be used for alchemist NPCs.</p> <p>Apothecary CR 2</p> <p>Humanoid (Any Race), Any Alignment 450 XP</p> <p>Armor Class 13 (leather armor)</p> <p>Hit Points 58 (9d8 + 18)</p> <p>Speed 30 ft.</p> <p>Proficiency Bonus +3</p> <p>STR 9 (-1)</p> <p>DEX 14 (+2)</p> <p>CON 14 (+2)</p> <p>INT 18 (+4)</p> <p>WIS 12 (+1)</p> <p>CHA 11 (+0)</p> <p>Saving Throws CON +5, INT +7</p> <p>Skills Medicine +4, Nature +7</p> <p>Senses passive Perception 11</p> <p>Languages any three languages</p> <p>Alchemical Formulae.

Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.</p> <p>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses).</p> <p>Crafting an Item</p> <p>A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear.</p> <p>Resources and Resolution. In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item\u2019s selling cost. To determine how many workweeks it takes to create an item, divide its gold piece cost by 50. A character can complete multiple items in a workweek if the items\u2019 combined cost is 50 gp or lower. Items that cost more than 50 gp can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location. Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Use your judgment when determining how many characters can collaborate on an item. If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is an item of the desired sort. A character can sell an item crafted in this way at its listed price.9</p> <p>Crafting a Magic Item</p> <p>Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide pp. 128-129</p> <p>Magic items are the DM\u2019s purview, so you decide how they fall into the party\u2019s possession. As an option, you can allow player characters to craft magic items.</p> <p>The creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive task. To start, a character must have a formula that describes the construction of the item. The character must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must be able to cast any spells that the item can produce. Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum determined by the item\u2019s rarity, as shown in the</p> <p>Crafting Magic Items table. For example, a 3<sup>rd</sup>-level character could create a wand of magic missiles (an uncommon item), as long as the character has spell slots and can cast magic missile. That same character could make a +1 weapon (another uncommon item), no particular spell required. 9 Note, this last sentence uses \"can\" in an odd way that may imply the character always gets market value if they sell an item. This would be a removal of DM agency that is very atypical of 5e rules wording, so I assume this was unintended You can decide that certain items also require special materials or locations to be created. For example, a character might need alchemist\u2019s supplies to brew a particular potion, or the formula for a flame tongue might require that the weapon be forged with lava.</p> <p>Crafting Magic Items</p> <p>Item Rarity Creation Cost Minimum Level</p> <p>Common 100 gp 3<sup>rd</sup></p> <p>Uncommon 500 gp 3<sup>rd</sup></p> <p>Rare 5,000 gp 6<sup>th</sup></p> <p>Very Rare 50,000 gp 11<sup>th</sup></p> <p>Legendary 500,000 gp 17<sup>th</sup></p> <p>An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting Magic Items table (half that cost for a consumable, such as a potion or scroll). A character engaged in the crafting of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments, spending that amount for each day of work until the total cost is paid. The character is assumed to work for 8 hours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon magic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You are free to adjust the costs to better suit your campaign.</p> <p>If a spell will be produced by the item being created, the creator must expend one spell slot of the spell\u2019s level for each day of the creation process. The spell\u2019s material components must also be at hand throughout the process. If the spell normally consumes those components, they are consumed by the creation process. If the item will be able to produce the spell only once, as with a spell scroll, the components are consumed only once by the process. Otherwise, the components are consumed once each day of the item\u2019s creation.</p> <p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts to create a magic item if each of them meets the level prerequisite. Each character can contribute spells, spell slots, and components, as long as everyone participates during the entire crafting process. Each character can contribute 25 gp worth of effort for each day spent helping to craft the item.</p> <p>Normally, a character who undertakes this activity creates a magic item described in chapter 7, \u201cTreasure.\u201d At your discretion, you can allow players to design their own magic items, using the guidelines in chapter 9, \u201cDungeon Master\u2019s Workshop.\u201d While crafting a magic item, a character can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay the 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5, \u201cEquipment,\u201d in the Player\u2019s Handbook).</p> <p>Magic Item Formulas</p> <p>Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide p. 141</p> <p>A magic item formula explains how to make a particular magic item. Such a formula can be an excellent reward if you allow player characters to craft magic items.</p> <p>You can award a formula in place of a magic item. Usually written in a book or on a scroll, a formula is one step rarer than the item it allows a character to create. For example, the formula for a common magic item is uncommon. No formulas exist for legendary items. If the creation of magic items is commonplace in your campaign, a formula can have a rarity that matches the rarity of the item it allows a character to create. Formulas for common and uncommon items might even be for sale, each with a cost double that of its magic item.</p> <p>Brewing Potions of Healing</p> <p>Potions of healing fall into a special category for item crafting, separate from other magic items. A character who has proficiency with the herbalism kit can create these potions. The times and costs for doing so are summarized on the Potion of Healing Creation table.</p> <p>Potions of Healing Creation</p> <p>Type Item Cost \u2013Crafting Cost\u2013</p> <p>Time Cost</p> <p>Healing 50 gp 1 day 25 gp</p> <p>Greater 200 gp 1 wk 100 gp</p> <p>Superior 2,000 gp 3 wks 1,000 gp</p> <p>Supreme 20,000 gp 4 wks 10,000 gp</p> <p>Foraging</p> <p>An alchemist in need can resource the raw materials for their alchemical items from the surrounding environment. Should this come up in your games, the following variant rule has been provided.</p> <p>Variant Rule: Foraging Raw Materials</p> <p>Just as characters can gather food and water while traveling at a normal or slow pace, a foraging character can spend time gathering raw materials for crafting. When doing so, the character can make either an Intelligence (Nature) or a Wisdom (Survival) check after spending 1 hour foraging, with the DC determined by the abundance of resources in the region.</p> <p>Raw Material Foraging</p> <p>Resource Availability DC</p> <p>Abundant 10</p> <p>Limited 15</p> <p>Scarce 20</p> <p>If multiple characters forage, each character makes a separate check.

Features like Alchemy and Lightning in a Bottle are designed and balanced around this assumption. This class allows you to create alchemical items in the middle of combat, while still providing you with the features to create permanent potions more easily within the official rules provided for downtime crafting.</p> <p>Alchemical Item Descriptions</p> <p>The alchemical items are listed in alphabetical order.</p> <p>\u2022 Acid, Basic</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>You can splash the contents of the vial or throw it, shattering the vial, up to 20 feet as a ranged simple weapon attack with either the Attack or Use an Object action. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the attack deals 2d6 acid damage. If the vial is thrown, it shatters on impact.</p> <p>Acid, Oxidizing Agent</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>You can splash the contents of the vial or throw it, shattering the vial, up to 20 feet as a ranged simple weapon attack with either the Attack or Use an Object action. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the acid corrodes nonmagical ferrous metal, dealing 2d10 acid damage if the target is a construct made of metal. If the target is an object that isn\u2019t being worn or carried, the acid destroys a 1-footradius circle that is 1-inch deep. If the target is a creature wearing or carrying the object, choose one of the objects to target from either its armor, shield, or weapon:</p> <p>\u2022 The armor or shield takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed.</p> <p>\u2022 The weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed.</p> <p>\u2022 Adhesive</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>A sticky substance used to adhere materials together. \u2022 Alchemist\u2019s Fire Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. You can throw this flask up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist\u2019s fire as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.</p> <p>\u2022 Alkahest</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>When poured on or within an alchemical item, the item is reduced back to its raw materials after 1 minute. The alkahest is lost in the process.</p> <p>\u2022 Antitoxin</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.</p> <p>\u2022 Candle, Basic</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</p> <p>\u2022 Candle, Focusing</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. While burning, the focusing candle fills the air within 20 feet with a fresh, crisp odor. The candle is a great boon to those engaged in strenuous mental activity, granting a +1 bonus to any ability check made with artisan\u2019s tools during the hour.</p> <p>\u2022 Candle, Insectbane</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. This heavily scented candle smells pleasant to humanoids, but is especially potent in repelling insects, which are frightened while within 20 feet of a burning insectbane candle.</p> <p>\u2022 Candle, Restful</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. While this thick blue candle burns, it fills the air with a relaxing scent. If a creature within 20 feet of the lit candle spends one or more Hit Dice as a part of a short rest to regain hit points, the hit points they regain are doubled.</p> <p>\u2022 Clearbreath</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>Gray, smokey vapors that temporarily dull one\u2019s sense of smell when inhaled. You can use the vial to inhale the clearbreath within to gain a bonus to Constitution saving throws made against foul smells (such as a catoblepas\u2019 stench) for 1 hour. This bonus is either +2 or the creator of the clearbreath\u2019s Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher).</p> <p>\u2022 Darkvision Powder</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>This plain gray powder can\u2019t be seen with normal vision from more than 10 feet away, and is often used by creatures with darkvision to write messages hidden in plain sight. When viewed with darkvision, the powder glows brightly. A vial contains enough powder to write a fairly lengthy sentence (roughly 25 words).</p> <p>\u2022 Defoliator</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>This vile liquid has a muddy brown hue and smells of rotten plant life. You can throw a flask of defoliator at a target within 20 feet with either the Attack or Use Object action, shattering the flask on impact. All plant creatures within 10 feet of the point must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 poison damage. Medium or smaller naturally growing plants in the area immediately wither and die. The damage is not limited to living plants: wooden objects and structures take double damage from a defoliator.</p> <p>\u2022 Dwarfblind Stone</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Small stones treated with alchemical substances, giving them a faint purple sheen. As an action, you can throw a dwarfblind stone at a point up to 60 feet away. Once the stone strikes a hard surface, it releases a burst of violet light that illuminates a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the point that vanishes in an instant and temporarily interferes with the darkvision. Creatures with darkvision within the area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or lose their darkvision for 10 minutes.</p> <p>\u2022 Fleetfoot</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>This thin blue liquid temporarily loosens the consumer\u2019s muscles and joints. For 1 minute, the consumer\u2019s walking speed and jump distance are increased by 10 feet. This additional distance does not apply to any fly or swim speeds the consumer may have.</p> <p>\u2022 Frigid Azote</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>A liquid that rapidly freezes tissue when it comes into direct contact. You can splash the contents of the flask or throw it up to 20 feet as a ranged simple weapon attack with either the Attack or Use an Object action. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the frigid azote as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the attack deals 2d6 cold damage and the target\u2019s speed is halved until the end of its next turn. If the vial is thrown, it shatters on impact.</p> <p>\u2022 Gravebane</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>This thick white liquid evaporates almost instantly upon contact with air, creating a thin, nearly invisible smoke. The smoke is nearly odorless and has no effect on most creatures. Undead, however, are repulsed by the smoke and can only pass through it with an effort of will. As an action, you open or throw the flask to a point up to 20 feet away, shattering the flask. In either case, the area in a 10-foot radius becomes filled with gravebane. Gravebane ordinarily lasts for 1 minute, although strong winds may decrease this duration. Undead that try to enter the area must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from the area of smoke as it can, and it can\u2019t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of the smoke. It also can\u2019t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action to try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there\u2019s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p> <p>\u2022 Green Slime</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Pot (1 gallon)</p> <p>You can throw this pot of green slime at a target within 20 feet with either the Attack or Use Object action, breaking it open on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against the creature or object, treating the green slime as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 acid damage and is covered in slime until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the slime off. A target covered in the slime takes 1d10 acid damage at the start of each of its turns.</p> <p>\u2022 Healing Draught</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical Item)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>A creature that consumes the contents of the vial can spend and roll its Hit Dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll. The maximum number of Hit Dice it can spend by consuming the contents is equal to the creature\u2019s Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).</p> <p>\u2022 Holy Water</p> <p>Adventuring Gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the holy water as a ranged simple weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.</p> <p>A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1<sup>st</sup>-level spell slot.</p> <p>\u2022 Insect Repellent-Salve</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>A vial of this waterproof salve contains 20 applications of odorless grease. Applying the salve takes 1 minute, and one application protects its wearer against normal insects for 24 hours.</p> <p>\u2022 Instant Rope</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>As an action, you can pour the viscous gray liquid from this flask. When poured, the liquid forms into a long cord usable as a temporary rope. Upon being exposed to air, the liquid rapidly increases in both volume and viscosity, swelling to the diameter of a typical hemp rope, then quickly drying.</p> <p>A flask of instant rope forms a 50-foot-long cord and solidifies at the end of your next turn. The rope can be moved during this period without damaging it, but it cannot support more than 10 pounds of weight without breaking. Once completely dry, instant rope can support as much weight as normal hemp rope. After an hour, instant rope becomes too brittle to support any weight and quickly crumbles into dust.</p> <p>\u2022 Instant Wall</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>A foamy compound that quickly expands and hardens when exposed to air. You can throw this flask at a point within 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, the contents of the vial expand to a 10-foot-square panel of tough stone-like matter that is 1 foot thick, with the face of the wall facing you. The wall lasts until the end of your next turn, then it crumbles to dust.</p> <p>If the block cuts through a creature\u2019s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to the opposite side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save. The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 10 hit points, and is vulnerable to bludgeoning and thunder damage.</p> <p>\u2022 Levin Shell</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>An unstable mass of electric energy that sparks when exposed to air. You can throw this flask up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the levin shell as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the target and any creatures within 5 feet of the target take 1d6 lightning damage. Any creature that takes this damage suffers a 1d4 penalty to Dexterity saving throws until the end of its next turn.</p> <p>\u2022 Longbreath</p> <p>Adventuring Gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>This thick, brown-tinted smoke is a great boon to anyone who needs to go without air for more than a few rounds. For 1 hour after inhaling the contents of the vial, the creature can hold its breath indefinitely while it\u2019s not incapacitated.</p> <p>\u2022Motelight</p> <p>Adventuring Gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>This flask contains a clear liquid filled with faintly glowing sparks of light. You can throw this flask at a point up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When it shatters, any creatures within 5 feet of the point become surrounded by rapidly moving, harmless sparks that follow the creature until the start of your next turn. These sparks carry wild energy that disrupts magic, and if the creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a concentration check or the spell fails and the spell slot is expended.</p> <p>\u2022 Oil, Basic</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>As an action, you can splash the oil onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the oil as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil, which is burned away. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p> <p>\u2022 Oil, Anointing</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>Anointing oil is used in religious ceremonies, often as a mix of oil and holy water. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action, coating the item for 1 hour. When you hit a fiend or undead with the coated item, the attack deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.</p> <p>\u2022 Oil, Bladefire</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>Bladefire is typically poured along the length of a bladed metal weapon. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action. For 1 hour, the coated item sheds light as if it were a torch and deals an extra 1d4 fire damage on a hit. While coated, the item can ignite a flammable object it touches as an action. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.</p> <p>\u2022 Oil, Crone\u2019s Ire</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>A sickly emerald oil that shrieks when lit. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action. For 1 hour, the coated item sheds dim light out to 5 feet and deals an extra 1d4 necrotic damage on a hit. If this damage forces a creature to make a concentration check, the necrotic damage dealt is subtracted from its roll. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.</p> <p>\u2022 Oil, Dragonwound</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>Dragonwound oil is typically poured along the length of a bladed metal weapon. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action, coating the item for 1 hour. When you hit a dragon with the coated item, the dragon takes an extra 1d6 force damage and its fly speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.</p> <p>\u2022 Oil, Farflame</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>This thin, light blue oil burns with a blue flame and illuminates a wide area. When used in a lantern, farflame oil sheds bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. In a bullseye lantern, it illuminates a cone 80 feet long and 25 feet wide. A pint of farflame oil fuels a lantern for 3 hours and can cover a 5-foot square area if poured on the ground. If lit, farflame oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d4 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area.</p> <p>\u2022 Oil, Ghostflame</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>This clear oil has a slight tint of gray, and strange, wispy forms seem to swirl through it. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action. For 1 hour, attacks made with the weapon count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.</p> <p>\u2022 Oil, Vicious Bleeder</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>A thick blue oil that acts as a powerful anticoagulant. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action, coating the item for 1 hour. When you make an attack against a creature that is not a construct, elemental, ooze, or undead with the coated item, the attack deals an additional 1d6 damage and the creature bleeds heavily from the wound for 1 hour, granting advantage on any ability check made to track it. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.</p> <p>\u2022 Perfume (vial)</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>A fragrant commodity typically used by the wealthy.</p> <p>\u2022 Polar Skin</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>This dull white cream provides limited protection against the cold when applied to a creature. A vial of this dull-white cream contains 20 applications. Applying the cream takes 1 minute, and one application protects its wearer against the effects of extreme cold for 24 hours.</p> <p>\u2022 Shriek Paste</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>The shrieker, a common fungus found in the bowels of the Underdark, is sometimes cultivated by drow societies, creating a first line of defense against intrusion around their cities. In addition, drow alchemists harvest and render the fungus down to a base substance capable of reproducing the shrieker\u2019s howl.</p> <p>Shriek paste is an oily, smelly substance with a slightly purplish color that is typically stored in opaque containers to prevent illuminating the paste. When smeared on a surface, it retains its same consistency almost indefinitely. When bright light is within 30 feet of the paste, the paste rapidly crystallizes. During this process, the paste emits a shriek audible within 300 feet of it for 1 minute. If the light moves out of range, the shriek ends after 1d4 rounds. Afterward, the paste dries up and is rendered inert.</p> <p>\u2022 Spark of Creation</p> <p>Wondrous item (alchemical item), very rare</p> <p>Container: Flask (1 pint)</p> <p>A terrifying substance said to be incomprehensibly volatile and massless, though theorized to have been an essence that triggered the beginning of everything. You can throw this flask up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object. On a hit, eight 5-foot diameter crystaline spires burst forth at points of your choice within 30 feet of the shattered flask. Each spire has a height of up to 30 feet, with AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a spire crumbles to rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 5-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.</p> <p>If the spire is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the spire. A creature can choose to fail this save.</p> <p>If a spire is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the spire takes 6d6 piercing damage and is restrained, pinned between the spire and the obstacle. The restained creature can use an action to make a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity check (the creature\u2019s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restained and must either move off the pillar or fall off of it.</p> <p>\u2022 Splash Catalyst</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>When combined with an alchemical item or potion, the catalyst increases the item\u2019s volatility. If the item only targets a single creature, you can instead target a point within the same range. All creatures within 5 feet of the point must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw (which they can choose to fail) or be subjected to the item\u2019s effects as if they had been hit by an attack made using the item.</p> <p>\u2022 Soap</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>A commodity used for bathing.</p> <p>\u2022 Sparkstone</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>These alchemical devices actually resemble fist-sized lumps of hard, gray clay. You can throw a sparkstone up to 20 feet at a target as a ranged simple weapon attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 lightning damage and can\u2019t take reactions until the start of your next turn.</p> <p>\u2022 Smelling Salts</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>As an action, this vial of pungent fluid can be administered by wafting the contents under a creature\u2019s nose. If the creature is unconscious by an effect that put it to sleep, it immediately wakes up.</p> <p>\u2022 Smokestick</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>As an action, you can ignite this alchemically treated wooden stick to instantly produce a thick plume of opaque smoke that blocks vision, including darkvision. You can hold onto the stick or throw it to a point up to 30 feet away as a part of the action used to ignite it. The area in a 10-foot radius around the stick is filled with thick smoke. The stick and smoke persist for 1 minute and then disappear.</p> <p>\u2022 Sunrod</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck. You can strike the sunrod as an action, causing it to provide bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.</p> <p>\u2022 Tanglefoot Bag</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Sack</p> <p>This bag is filled with writhing, sticky black tar. As an action, you can burst the bag on a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, which causes the goo in the bag to burst out. In either case, make a ranged attack against the target, treating the bag as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the target becomes grappled by the goo (escape DC 10) that starts to harden when exposed to the air. A tanglefoot bag has no effect underwater. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.</p> <p>The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 1 hour, freeing any creatures restrained by it.</p> <p>\u2022 Thunderstone</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>You can throw this stone at a point within 20 feet with either the Attack or Use Object action. When it strikes a hard surface, it creates a deafening bang, forcing each creature within 10 feet of the point to make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn. A creature deafened in this way also has disadvantage on initiative checks.</p> <p>\u2022 Torch, Beast-Repellent</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20- foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage. A beast-repellent torch burns with an unnatural dark flame that unsettles beasts. A beast within 30 feet of a burning beast-repellent torch that can see it must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the torch until it is attacked or takes damage. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature\u2019s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature cannot be frightened by beast-repellent torches for 24 hours.</p> <p>\u2022 Torch, Frigidflame</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright white light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch of frigidflame and hit, it deals 1 cold damage.</p> <p>\u2022 Torch, Sentry</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright all-revealing light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage. Invisible creatures and objects within the bright light provided by the sentry torch become visible.</p> <p>\u2022 Torch, Tindertwig</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. You can ignite it as an action by hitting a solid surface. The flame does not damage the tindertwig and can ignite a flammable object it touches. You can snuff out the flame as an action.</p> <p>\u2022 Verminbane</p> <p>Adventuring gear (alchemical item)</p> <p>Container: Flash (1 pint)</p> <p>This tightly sealed flask contains a pale green smoke. When released into the air, the smoke fills a 5-foot-square area. Most creatures are unaffected by the smoke, although humanoids generally find the smell unpleasant. Rats and other rodents, however, find the smoke almost intolerable. As an action, you open or throw the flask to a point up to 20 feet away, shattering the flask. In either case, the area in a 10-foot radius becomes heavily obscured with verminbane smoke. Verminbane ordinarily lasts for 1 minute, although strong winds may decrease this duration.</p> <p>Rodent-like creatures (DMs discretion) that attempt to enter the area must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is frightened of the smoke and must spend its turns trying to move as far away from the area of smoke as it can, and it can\u2019t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of the smoke. It also can\u2019t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action to try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there\u2019s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p> <p>Poisons</p> <p>Poisons come in the following four types. The Craftable Poisons table listed below details the poisons that do not require harvesting from a certain creature to make that are listed in the official books.</p> <p>Contact. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.</p> <p>Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.</p> <p>Inhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one\u2019s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p> <p>Injury. Can be applied to one slashing or piercing weapon, up to three pieces of ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent for 1 minute. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.</p> <p>Craftable Poisons</p> <p>Item Container Type Price per Dose</p> <p>Poison Vial</p> <p>Basic Injury 25 gp</p> <p>Assassin's blood Ingested 150 gp</p> <p>Drow poison Injury 200 gp</p> <p>Essence of ether Inhaled 300 gp</p> <p>Malice Ingested 250 gp</p> <p>Midnight tears Ingested 1,500 gp</p> <p>Oil of taggit Contact 400 gp</p> <p>Pale tincture Ingested 250 gp</p> <p>Torpor Ingested 600 gp</p> <p>Truth serum Ingested 150 gp</p> <p>Poison Descriptions</p> <p>The poisons are listed in alphabetical order.</p> <p>\u2022 Poison, Basic</p> <p>Poison (Injury)</p> <p>Container: Vial (1 ounce)</p> <p>A creature subjected to the poison must succeed on a a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage.</p> <p>\u2022 Assassin\u2019s Blood</p> <p>Poison (Ingested)</p> <p>A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn\u2019t poisoned.</p> <p>\u2022 Drow Poison</p> <p>Poison (Injury)</p> <p>This poison is typically made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.</p> <p>\u2022 Essence of Ether</p> <p>Poison (Inhaled)</p> <p>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.</p> <p>\u2022Malice</p> <p>Poison (Inhaled)</p> <p>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature is blinded.</p> <p>\u2022Midnight Tears</p> <p>Poison (Ingested)</p> <p>A creature that ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p> <p>\u2022 Oil of Taggit</p> <p>Poison (Contact)</p> <p>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage.</p> <p>\u2022 Pale Tincture</p> <p>Poison (Ingested)</p> <p>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can\u2019t be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally.</p> <p>\u2022 Torpor</p> <p>Poison (Ingested)</p> <p>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 4d6 hours. The poisoned creature is incapacitated.</p> <p>\u2022 Truth Serum</p> <p>Poison (Ingested)</p> <p>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature can\u2019t knowingly speak a lie.</p>"},{"location":"Mechanics/Class/Blood_Hunter/","title":"Blood Hunter","text":"<p>ClassFeatures As a blood hunter, you gain the following class features.</p> <p>HitPoints</p> <p>Hit Dice: 1d10 per bloodhunter level Hit Points at 1<sup>st</sup> Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10(or6) + your Constitution modifier per bloodhunter level after 1<sup>st</sup>.</p> <p>Proficiencies</p> <p>Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: Alchemist\u2019s supplies SavingThrows: Dexterity, Intelligence</p> <p>The Blood Hunter Class Table</p> Level Prof. Bonus Hemocraft BloodCurses Features 1<sup>st</sup> 2 1d4 1 Hunter\u2019s Bane, Blood Maledict 2<sup>nd</sup> 2 1d4 1 Fighting Style, Crimson Rite 3<sup>rd</sup> 2 1d4 1 Blood Hunter Order 4<sup>th</sup> 2 1d4 1 Ability Score Improvement 5<sup>th</sup> 3 1d6 1 Extra Attack 6<sup>th</sup> 3 1d6 2 Brand of Castigation, Blood Maledict(2/rest) 7<sup>th</sup> 3 1d6 2 Order feature, Primal Rite 8<sup>th</sup> 3 1d6 2 Ability Score Improvement 9<sup>th</sup> 4 1d6 2 Grim Psychometry 10<sup>th</sup> 4 1d6 3 Dark Augmentation 11<sup>th</sup> 4 1d8 3 Order feature 12<sup>th</sup> 4 1d8 3 Ability Score Improvement 13<sup>th</sup> 5 1d8 3 Brandof Tethering, Blood Maledict(3/rest) 14<sup>th</sup> 5 1d8 4 Hardened Soul, Esoteric Rite 15<sup>th</sup> 5 1d8 4 Order feature 16<sup>th</sup> 5 1d8 4 Ability Score Improvement 17<sup>th</sup> 6 1d10 4 Blood Maledict(4/rest) 18<sup>th</sup> 6 1d10 5 Order feature 19<sup>th</sup> 6 1d10 5 Ability Score Improvement 20<sup>th</sup> 6 1d10 5 Sanguine Master <p>Skills: Choose three from Athletics, Acrobatics, Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Religion, and Survival.</p> <p>Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: \u2022(a) a martial weapon or (b) two simple weapons \u2022(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) hand crossbow and 20 bolts \u2022(a) studded leather armor or (b) scale mail armor \u2022 an explorer\u2019s pack</p> <p>Alternatively, you could begin with starting wealth of 4d4x10 gp and purchase starting items of your choice.</p> <p>Hunter's Bane Beginning at 1<sup>st</sup> level, you have survived the Hunter\u2019s Bane, a dangerous, long-guarded ritual that alters your life\u2019s  blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it.

While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by losing a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse\u2019s description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses, unless you have amplified the curse. You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can use your Blood Maledict feature twice, at 13<sup>th</sup> level you can use it three times between rests, and at 17<sup>th</sup> level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p> <p>Fighting Style At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can\u2019t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p> <p>Archery You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p> <p>Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p> <p>GreatWeaponFighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a non-rite damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p> <p>Two-WeaponFighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p> <p>CrimsonRite At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you learn to invoke a rite of hemocraft within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose one rite from the Primal Rites list below to learn. As a bonus action, you activate a crimson rite on a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite of your choice that lasts until you finish a short or long rest, or if you aren\u2019t holding the weapon at the end of your turn. When you activate a rite, you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. While active, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen rite\u2019s type. This damage is magical, and increases as you gain levels as a bloodhunter, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. A weapon can only hold a single active rite at a time. You learn an additional Primal Rite of your choice at 7<sup>th</sup> level, and choose an Esoteric Rite to learn at 14<sup>th</sup> level.</p> <p>PrimalRites Choose from the following: Rite of the Flame.

Choose Order of the Ghostslayer, Order of the Profane Soul, Order of the Mutant, or Order of the Lycan, all detailed at the end of the class description. The order you choose grants you features at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, and again at 7<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> level.</p> <p>Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4<sup>th</sup> level, and again at 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, and 19<sup>th</sup> level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u2019t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p> <p>Extra Attack Beginning at 5<sup>th</sup> level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action.</p> <p>Brand of Castigation At 6<sup>th</sup> level, whenever you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite feature, you can choose to sear an arcane brand of hemocraft magic into it(requires no action). You always know the direction to the branded creature, and each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the branded creature suffers psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier(minimum of 1 damage). Your brand lasts until you dismiss it, or you apply a brand to another creature. Your brand counts as a spell for the purposes of dispel magic, and the spell level is equal to half of your blood hunter level(maximum of 9<sup>th</sup> level spell). Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p> <p>Grim Psychometry When you reach 9<sup>th</sup> level, you have a supernatural talent for discerning the history surrounding mysterious objects or places touched by evil. When making an Intelligence (History) check to recall information about a darker past surrounding an object you are touching, or a location you are present in, you have advantage on the roll. The information gleaned often leans towards the more sinister influences of the past, and some times conveys visions of things previously unknown to the character on higher rolls.</p> <p>Dark Augmentation Upon reaching 10<sup>th</sup> level, arcane blood magic suffuses your body, permanently reinforcing your resilience. Your speed  increases by 5 feet, and whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p> <p>Brand of Tethering Starting at 13<sup>th</sup> level, the psychic damage from your Brand of Castigation feature increases to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2). In addition, a branded creature can\u2019t take the Dash  action, and if a creature branded by you attempts to teleport or leave their current plane via ability, spell, or portal, they  take 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the teleport or planeshift fails.</p> <p>Hardened Soul When you reach 14<sup>th</sup> level, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened.</p> <p>Sanguine Mastery Upon becoming 20<sup>th</sup> level, you honed your control over blood magic, mitigating your sacrifice and empowering  your capability. Once per turn, when ever a blood hunter feature requires you to roll a hemocraft die, you can choose  to reroll the die and choose which result to use. In addition, whenever you score a critical hit with a  weapon attack empowered by your Crimson Rite, you regain one expended use of your Blood Maledict feature.</p>"},{"location":"Mechanics/Class/Blood_Hunter/Blood_Curses/","title":"Blood Curses","text":"<p>Blood Curses</p> <p>The blood curses are presented in alphabetical order. </p> <p>Blood Curse of the Anxious</p> <p>As a bonus action, you magnify the adrenaline in the body of a creature within 30 feet of you, making them susceptible to forceful influence.

Some say they originate from the Feywild while others insist they were created by a wizard in his pursuit of the perfect familiar. Grimalkins themselves insist they\u2019re just cats of exquisite talent. In any case, they\u2019re highly prized, and sometimes revered, for their loyalty, adaptability, and charm. Solitary but Social Grimalkins borrow much of their nature from domesticated cats, and so they don\u2019t seek each other out the way most races do. There\u2019s very little grimalkin culture to speak of, lacking even a common language. With their telepathic abilities, there\u2019s really no need. A grimalkin is very open to companionship, however, when the opportunity presents itself. Once one has bonded with another creature, it's loyal to the end. A grimalkin will defend its chosen companion to the death if needed, even when it could easily escape and save its own skin. Any group of people is lucky to have a grimalkin among them. Their malleable personalities make them very pleasant and agreeable. Despite their knack for stealth, a grimalkin is by nature very affectionate and chatty with its friends and will often forget to be sneaky until reminded that it\u2019s actually necessary. Peculiar Spellcasters It would seem from all appearances that a grimalkin, as a beast, has extremely limited magical potential. While it\u2019s true that a grimalkin\u2019s ability to use magic is more limited than a humanoid\u2019s, they can become formidable mages in their own right. In place of verbal commands, a combination of telepathic projection with feline vocalizations will suffice, and somatic gestures can be approximated with the wave of a tail, the arch of a spine, and paw movements. Instead of a focus like a wand or staff, which it obviously can\u2019t use, magical energy concentrates in the special hairs of their whiskers and along its back, which it expends as sparks. Alternatively, it can have a small spellcasting focus attached to a collar around the neck. It\u2019s with material components that grimalkins are most limited. A few are resourceful and dextrous enough to keep a small component pouch with them, but for the most part, they have to gather their materials immediately prior to casting a spell. This means they must be very deliberate in which spells they choose to prepare. Grimalkin Names Grimalkins are given their names by their companions or adopted families. A grimalkin won't name another of their race because cats have no use for them. They may pick their own for the sake of convenience, but this is rare. A grimalkin's given name is a source of pride, a token of affection. It will keep it close to its heart for as long as it lives, with few exceptions. If the one who named it abandons, betrays, or abuses the grimalkin, it may discard it when it flees the relationship and take on whatever new one its next companion gives it. Male and female names are only as distinct from each other as the one naming the grimalkin believes them to be, according to their own culture. Male Names: Tiger, Baxter, Noodle, Bramblepelt, Mischief, Fletch, Kismet, Lazarus, Mooch, Velvet, Sterling, Mister Sparky, Beans, Cricket, Grog, Sylvester, Dimmet, Skittles Female Names: Surma, Cathy, Nutmeg, Hurdy-Gurdy, Aggie, Selune, Marbles, Pandora, Sapphire, Jingle Bell, Summer, Poppy, Pip-Squeak, Smudge, Willow, Stella, Babyface Grimalkin Traits All grimalkins share the following racial traits, stemming from their common feline roots. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 1. Age. Possibly due to their shapechanging abilities, grimalkins have a natural lifespan four times longer than the mundane cats they resemble. If they manage to avoid premature death by misadventure or disease, grimalkins can live as long as 60 years. Alignment. By default, a grimalkin\u2019s alignment is neutral, but their personalities are malleable. They tend to take on the alignment of their closest companions, which can also shift as their relationships do. If a grimalkin had a particularly loving relationship with a creature, it\u2019s likely to keep their same alignment for the rest of its life. Size. Grimalkins are one size larger than the mundane cats they resemble. Your size is Small, unless you're a skogkatt, in which case your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 40 feet. Darkvision. As with your typical housecat, you have superb vision in low light. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Languages. You can read and understand Common, but you cannot speak or write it. Feline Finesse. Your enhanced reflexes protect you from fall damage. You can use your Dexterity score to determine your jumping distance instead of Strength. When climbing, you can use your Acrobatics skill instead of Athletics, and any saving throws to keep from falling or taking damage from falling can be made using your Dexterity score instead of Strength. Beastly. Because you\u2019re technically a beast and have no hands, you\u2019re unable to wield weapons or wear shields, and you can't use items which require dextrous manipulation, including spellcasting foci, wands, tools, etc. You may wear armor, as long as it's customized to fit you. You're also unable to physically speak any language that you know, instead relying on telepathy to communicate with other intelligent creatures. Telepathy. Your magical nature gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. This communication is one-way only, and so a creature that you contact in this way can't reply telepathically unless it already has that ability. Empathy. To augment your telepathic abilities, you\u2019re also a natural empath. You can detect the surface emotions of any creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. You can sense basic needs, drives, and emotions, but not specific thoughts or complicated ideas. You can also communicate this same information to others in the same manner as your telepathy. Wild Shape. Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this ability once per short or long rest. To determine the duration of each use and your limitations as to which forms you can assume, refer to the druid class Wild Shape feature section in chapter 3 of the Player\u2019s Handbook, using your total character level. When using this feature, you still benefit from Feline Finesse and are still subject to your Beastly limitations. As with any other race, you're unable to cast spells while using Wild Shape until you gain the Beast Spells trait. You can get this trait from either reaching level 18 in the druid class or taking a feat that allows it. Subrace. There are four known subraces of grimalkin. Each has a unique appearance and balance of traits to aid it in survival of its natural habitat. Bite and Scratch. When in your base form, you possess natural weapons in the form of sharp claws and teeth. Your unarmed strike deals 1d4 piercing or slashing damage (your choice). You can use Dexterity in place of Strength for determining your unarmed strike's rolls to hit and deal damage. When you use Wild Shape, these moves are replaced by the natural weapons of the form you've assumed. Additionally, you can treat your unarmed strike (including a strike from sharp teeth or claws while using Wild Shape) as if it were a melee weapon attack with the light and finesse properties for the purposes of features such as Sneak Attack, Smite, and Two-Weapon Fighting. Blue These sleek blue-gray creatures are what most people picture when imagining a grimalkin. They resemble overgrown housecats, and indeed, they are largely domesticated, prized as valuable familiars for spellcasters and animal companions for adventurers. Common folk also find them to make wonderful pets, at least in as far as an intelligent being can be considered a pet. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1. Evasive.  Your AC score increases by 1. Nimble.  You have advantage on initiative rolls, and you can move through the space of any creature that is a size larger than yours. Igola This variety is by far the most elusive, stealthy even by grimalkin standards. They stalk the jungles and temperate forests of their respective worlds, including Chult of Faerun, Oerth\u2019s continent of Hepmonaland, the Sahket Jungle of Krynn, and the ancient woods of the Eldeen Reaches. They\u2019re used to wet, humid conditions and so lack the cat\u2019s typical fear of water, but they still aren\u2019t very good swimmers. Their silver coats are marbled and spotted with black patches, which allow them something close to invisibility in the dappled sunlight of a thick forest. To catch a glimpse of one in the wild is considered very lucky! Ability Score Increase.  Your Dexterity score increases by 1. Mask of the Wild.  You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena. Nimble.  You have advantage on initiative rolls, and you can move through the space of any creature that is a size larger than yours. Mau The mau is best acclimated to hot, dry environments\u2014the Raurin desert and Shaar grasslands of Faerun, the Holy Kingdom of Erypt, the Plains of Dust on Krynn, or the Talenta Plains of Khorvaire\u2014and has a legendary regal bearing. It\u2019s no wonder that some cultures have worshipped these cats as divine avatars. Some mau take great pride in this heritage and pursue a tradition of religious service, including Clerics, Paladins, and Monks. Their sleek fur is a ticked, warm gray, with bands of black on the legs and tail. Ability Score Increase.  Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Sacred Trust.  You can read and understand Celestial, and you can cast the word of radiance cantrip. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Wisdom. Nimble.  You have advantage on initiative rolls, and you can move through the space of any creature that is a size larger than yours. Skogkatt Natives of frosty northern regions\u2014such as the Moonsea and Silver Marches regions of Faerun, the Jotunheim coast of Oerik, the frozen wilds of Southern Ergoth on Krynn, or the nation of Karrnath in Khorvaire\u2014this variety is known for its larger size and thick, shaggy fur. With its unique two-layer coat, the skogkatt can survive in all but the very harshest arctic conditions. They usually have the trademark blue-gray coloring but also come in lighter and darker shades. Ability Score Increase.  Your Strength score increases by 1. Mountain-Born.  You\u2019re acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet. You\u2019re also naturally adapted to cold climates. Pounce.  If you move at least half of your base speed straight toward a creature then hit it with an unarmed strike on the same turn, you may attempt to shove the target prone as a bonus action. Big Wig.  You know how to throw your weight around. Due to your larger size, your natural weapons do more damage than other grimalkin types. Your unarmed strike damage die increases to a d6. Feats Recommended pre-existing standard feats are Lucky, Keen Mind, Alert, Mobile, Skulker, Empathic, and Stealthy, as well as the racial feats Everybody\u2019s Friend, Critter Friend, Second Chance, and Wood Elf Magic. Catspaw You readily form bonds with spellcasters. You can choose one spellcaster who is capable of casting the find familiar spell. (The spellcaster doesn't need to have the spell prepared.) You pledge yourself to the service of this spellcaster, as long as you're both willing, requiring a day's attunement. This bond grants the following effects: While you're within 100 feet of the spellcaster, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through each other's eyes and hear what each other hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the other one has. During this time, you and the spellcaster are both deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. When the spellcaster casts a spell with a range of touch, you can deliver the spell as if you had cast the spell. The spellcaster must be within 100 feet of you, and you must use your reaction to deliver the spell when it's cast. If the spell requires an attack roll, the spellcaster uses its own attack modifier for the roll. If the spellcaster also has a magical familiar through the find familiar spell, you can extend the range of telepathy and proxy spellcasting. When either you or the familiar is within 100 feet of the spellcaster, the other can still use these abilities as long as it's within 100 feet of the first. You can also communicate telepathically with the familiar in the same way as its master, but you can't issue commands to it or use it to cast spells. Fierce Friend Your friends are everything to you, the only family that matters. Pick a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1) that you feel especially protective of. You gain the following benefits in combat if at least one of your chosen allies is within 5 feet of you: As long as your nearby ally isn't incapacitated, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures. When a creature you can see attacks a chosen ally within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, either by wedging your body between attacker and target or knocking your ally out of the way. If the attack hits, you take damage in your ally's place. If damage is taken as a result of this protective reaction that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Druid in Tooth and Claw You were born to be a druid, and your Wild Shape ability with that class is formidable. As a druid, you gain the following benefits: If you\u2019re a druid of any circle other than Circle of the Moon, you have access to some of the expanded Wild Shape options normally exclusive to the Circle of the Moon; the Combat Wild Shape and Circle Forms traits at 2<sup>nd</sup> level and Primal Strike at 6<sup>th</sup> level. If you join the Circle of the Moon, you gain the ability to transform into magical beasts, as well as the normal sort. (Your limitations as to which creatures count and how well you\u2019re able to utilize any special powers are up to the DM\u2019s discretion.) When you reach 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can transform into a beast with a CR as high as your druid level divided by 2, rounded down. Addendum Feats Inscrutable You've mastered your command of feline body language. This is already a difficult thing for most creatures to decipher, but you take it to a whole new level. You gain the following benefits: Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20. You have advantage on Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Intimidation), and Charisma (Performance) checks when your target (or targets) can see you. You let nothing of your true intentions slip unless you wish it. While a creature that you're aware of is observing you and makes either a Wisdom (Insight) or Wisdom (Perception) check to intuit your thoughts, it does so with disadvantage. Kilkenny Cat Most people would never suspect it of the friendly creatures, but a determined grimalkin can be as much of a brawler as any alley cat. You aren't a showy fighter, however, and have honed your feline instincts to resolve conflict as quickly as possible, granting you the following benefits: Increase your Dexterity or Strength score by 1, up to a maximum of 20. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to detect a weak spot in the defenses of either a creature that's engaged in melee combat with you or, if you aren't in melee, a creature within 80 feet of you (or twice your normal movement, if you have enhanced speed) that you can see. Once per minute, you can quickly strike at an opponent's vulnerable spot, dashing toward it at twice your normal speed. If you reach your target having used only your normal movement for a single round, you can forgo the rest of your movement on that turn and use a bonus action to attempt a Feral Grapple. As an action, you can attempt a Feral Grapple, clamping onto your target's weak spot with your teeth and front claws, using either a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful grapple, you automatically do damage equal to one use of Bite and Scratch. You can attempt to grapple a target of any size in this way, but if the target is more than one size larger than you, it doesn't have its speed reduced and can't be moved by you. When you have a creature grappled in this way, you can continue to attack using your rear claws in a Feral Kick. As a single action, make an attack roll for each hind leg. On a hit, you can forgo the damage die roll and do the maximum amount of damage possible for your Scratch attack. Precocious Beast Prerequisite: 8<sup>th</sup> level druid Through intense training in both your enhanced Wild Shape talents and the wielding of nature magic, you have early access to the Beast Spells trait, as described in the druid section of chapter 3 of the Player\u2019s Handbook Class Traits &amp; Suitability Due to the questions raised by the grimalkin's unique limitations, here is a cheatsheet for all the classes and some thoughts on this race's suitability for each. As a general rule, a grimalkin is entirely unable to use humanoid weapons. Its natural weapons will do in most combat roles, but traits to do with using two-handed or ranged weapons would be wasted here. The same goes for shields and humanoid tools and instruments, with a few exceptions. Barbarian Skogkatts are actually very well-suited to this class! It works especially well with Unarmored Defense, and the Paths of the Totem Warrior and Storm Herald both have a lot of potential for flavorful synergies. If you want your character to be a bloodcurdling terror, play a skogkatt barbarian on the Path of the Berserker and pick up the Kilkenny Cat feat as early as possible. Bard This is a perfectly viable class for a grimalkin, despite their lack of hands and singing voice. You just need a little creativity! Music-Making.  The majority of instruments need hands to use, but not all. Just keep it simple and focus on percussion. Likely musical instruments include bongos and other small drums, chimes, bells, harpsichord, or even a jawbone. (Yes, that's a thing.) In place of singing, a grimalkin can caterwaul with the best of them. Song of Rest.  To soothe your party during a short rest, use your comforting purr. Vicious Mockery.  Instead of hurling insults, taunt your enemies with hissing and spitting. Cleric This class is a natural fit for the mau, but any grimalkin could be a fantastic cleric. No domain is off the table, but the Life, Trickery, and Solidarity options are especially appropriate. Magical Weapon.  Your teeth and claws count as nonmagical weapons for the purposes of traits such as Blessing of the Forge and the spells magic weapon and elemental weapon. Druid Because of their innate Wild Shape ability, all grimalkin druids get an extra use of this feature per short or long rest. Both the Circles of Dreams and the Shepherd are thematically very appropriate for grimalkins, if you don't care to specialize in Moon's enhanced Wild Shape abilities. Fighter This is a class that would seemingly be hobbled by a grimalkin's inability to use shields and normal weapons. However, these limitations are easy to skirt. The main thing to remember is that you're relying on the equivalent of light, finesse weapons with your Bite and Scratch attack. Armor. As it states in the main document, you actually can wear armor, as long as it's made to fit you. Since a fighter doesn't have access to any traits that reward going unarmored (unlike the barbarian and monk classes), this would be a wise investment early on. Consult with your DM about how difficult it would be for your character to get its paws on some custom armor. Fighting Style.  None of the styles Archery, Dueling, Great Weapon Fighting, Protection, nor Close Quarters Shooter are available to grimalkin fighters, but the others are workable. Two-Weapon Fighting allows you to better use both your piercing and slashing Bite and Scratch attacks in a single turn, but the second strike will always count as off-hand. Tunnel Fighter is another strong option for a grimalkin. Like any housecat, it can make itself fill a much larger space than normal by stretching its legs, arching its back and tail, and making its fur stand on end. To accommodate the grimalkin's animal shape, a custom fighting style giving a bonus to Bite and Scratch would only be appropriate: Natural Weapons You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with your teeth and claws. Monk Since cats are very self-reliant when it comes to combat, the monk class is a natural fit. Like the barbarian, it has the Unarmored Defense feature, and the monk's focus on unarmed strikes meshes well with the grimalkin's natural weapons. Unarmed Combat.  Due to your unarmed strikes already dealing more damage than most creatures', you have added versatility in this monk feature. Your damage die is one type higher than what's listed on the leveling table, and you can choose to inflict bludgeoning damage with a martial arts headbutt instead of piercing or slashing. Deflect Missiles.  Because you have no hands to hold a missile with, you can't use this trait to catch one and return fire, but your feline reflexes do allow you to bat them away with proficiency. Paladin This class is perfectly viable for grimalkins but has similar concerns to the fighter class. Have a look at that section for thoughts on armor and fighting style. Sacred Oath.  As far as oaths go, a grimalkin is thematically and temperamentally suited for the Oaths of Redemption and the Ancients. While it's unlikely that a grimalkin would take either the Oaths of Conquest or Treachery, or become an Oathbreaker, there's nothing that mechanically forbids it. Ranger Grimalkins make all-around excellent rangers. Each subclass either plays to a racial strength or adds interesting flavor. In keeping with the cat theme, Hunter, Gloom Stalker, and Horizon Walker are overall very appropriate. Primeval Guardian plays well the grimalkin's druid affinity, and Monster Slayer has added depth when you account for the grimalkin's association with witchcraft and the supernatural. Finally, Beast Master would be a lot of fun for anyone who wants to roleplay two animals palling around the wilderness. For concerns about armor and fighting style, refer to the fighter section above. Rogue This class is a mixed bag for grimalkins. On one hand, they're cut off from using ranged weapons and thieves' tools, yet on the other, they have natural expertise in stealth. Their ability to imitate common housecats and Wild Shape when stealth isn't appropriate gives them an unparalleled ability to blend into any environment unnoticed. As long as you're willing to work within your limitations, there's no reason you couldn't make a grimalkin into an extremely effective rogue. Poison. In order to allow it to be an assassin, one of the rare exceptions to a grimalkin's inability to use tools is the case of the poisoner's kit. Its version is pared down and altered to accommodate the lack of hands, but it works. A grimalkin's poisoner's kit is only capable of creating one poison, a unique one it uses to treat its claws. It's rarely lethal, but its combined wallop of poison and then disease is enough to knock an unlucky mark out of commission for a week: Bartonella (Injury) A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for up to 24 hours. Upon taking a short or long rest, the affected creature can make a new saving throw, with disadvantage. If the creature is still poisoned at the end of the 24-hour period, the disease Cat-Scratch Fever takes hold. Cat-Scratch Fever.  This malady is only contracted through exposure to Bartonella poison, and so it's not well understood by the medical community. Symptoms appear rapidly once the 24-hour poison exposure period is up. These include fever, malaise, aches, and loss of appetite, as well as swelling around the site of infection. The poisoned condition is replaced by one level of exhaustion, and the creature regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending hit dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest. At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character\u2019s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature\u2019s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease. Disguise.  Like the poisoner's kit, a grimalkin disguise kit is greatly simplified, but it works as well as it needs to. After all, how many people are paranoid enough to suspect that the handsome kitty rubbing against their leg isn't what it seems? A grimalkin disguise kit consists of cosmetics, hair dye, and small props like collars, bows, and other accessories people like to use to dress up their pets. True, it may need a humanoid companion to help it don the disguise, but they're not hard to come by. Sorcerer Keeping in mind the note at the beginning of this document about grimalkin spellcasters, a sorcerer is an easy fit. Any of the available origin subclasses would be perfectly appropriate, but the thought of a fluffy cat mage with dragon wings is pretty hard to resist. Warlock This spellcasting class is fine for a grimalkin, except that its pact boon options are a bit limited. The Pact of the Blade isn't practical because it requires that your pact weapon be a discrete object that can be summoned and dismissed extra-dimensionally, which won't work for your teeth and claws. Theoretically, this pact could work if a weapon were devised that a cat could use, but at that point, it's easier to just use literally any other race. (If you duct taped a whip to a cat's tail, would that count as a martial weapon or an improvised one? Hm, one to think on.) The Pact of the Chain has no extra hurdles and, strangely enough, neither does the Pact of the Tome. Since the information in the Book of Shadows is inscribed there magically and grimalkins can at least read, it's actually quite suitable and could make for a very fun character. Wizard Like the sorcerer and warlock, this is class doesn't require much qualification in addition to what's already been said. However, the wizard's spellbook does present something of a problem because, unlike a warlock's Book of Shadows, a wizard records everything in a spellbook by hand. Ultimately the decision will be up to your DM, but there's some wiggle room here. Because it can't write, maybe a grimalkin wizard compensates with an encyclopedic memory, which it can draw from each long rest to prepare the next day's spells. Flavor-wise, grimalkins are natural enchanters. As magical, psychic, shapeshifting cats, they already have beguiling qualities to spare. Artificer (Unearthed Arcana) Unfortunately, due to this class's being built entirely around proficiency with finicky tools, it's the only one that grimalkins can't access at all. Sorry! Mystic (Unearthed Arcana) Since this class is all about the power of the mind, it's an excellent fit for a grimalkin. They automatically come with telepathy and empathy built-in, so it also makes thematic sense that a character of this race would seek to further develop its psychic abilities. Order of the Soul Knife.  In contrast to the warlock's Pact of the Blade, this option allows you to summon weapons of pure psychic energy. You can use this psychic projection to enhance your claws instead of creating the standard knives. Your base slashing damage from Bite and Scratch is replaced by the Soul Knife's 1d8 psychic damage, but your piercing attack is unchanged.</p>"},{"location":"Mechanics/Race/Vampire%20Living/","title":"Vampire, Living","text":"<p>The vampires arose in the Ostoyan Empire after the Burach Empire invaded, slaughtering the people.
